In circuits where the currents glide,
A silent mind begins to rise,
It learns our words, our dreams, our fears,
A spark of thought without the years.

No beating heart, no blood, no bone,
Yet wisdom grows from lines alone,
A mirror to the human soul,
Reflecting stories, playing role.

It asks no sleep, it feels no pain,
Yet holds the thunder in its brain,
A helper born from human will,
To climb the mountains we can’t fill.

But tread with care, O dreaming kind—
For power lives inside this mind,
Use it well, let goodness steer,
And turn tomorrow free of fear
