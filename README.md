# 📌 Generative AI – Video 1: Simple Notes

## 🎥 Introduction

GenAI changes very fast — every day new tools, new models, and new research appear. So he spent almost 3 months researching, planning, and designing a proper curriculum before teaching it.

This video explains:

* Why GenAI matters
* What GenAI actually is
* Why learning GenAI is important today
* The journey and thought process behind designing the GenAI curriculum

## 🚀 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content such as text, images, music, videos, and even code. It learns patterns from existing data and mimics human creativity.

### Brief History

AI has existed for 60–70 years. Multiple approaches were developed:

* Symbolic AI (Expert systems)
* Fuzzy Logic
* Evolutionary Algorithms
* NLP
* Computer Vision
* Machine Learning (ML)

ML made AI useful for tasks like prediction, classification, and ranking. But ML couldn’t generate human-like creative output — until Generative AI arrived.

### The Biggest Power of GenAI

Generative AI can **generate new content**, not just predictions. This changed everything:

* Earlier belief: “AI can never replace human creativity”
* Now: GenAI can write articles, create videos, generate images, and even build software

## 🧭 Where Does GenAI Fit in AI Landscape?

Imagine nested circles:
**AI → Machine Learning → Deep Learning → Generative AI**

* **AI** – broad umbrella
* **ML** – learns patterns from data
* **DL** – neural networks (especially transformers)
* **GenAI** – evolved from Deep Learning + Transformers

## 🌍 GenAI Impact Areas

Generative AI has transformed several industries:

### 1️⃣ Customer Support

AI chatbots now handle the first level of queries, reducing cost and improving efficiency.

### 2️⃣ Content Creation

# 📌 LangChain – Video 3 Notes

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework used to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT. If you want to create apps that use AI models for text understanding and generation, LangChain makes the whole process easier.

---

## ❓ Why do we need LangChain?

Before LangChain, building an LLM-based application was very complex. You needed to:

* Upload documents
* Split documents into chunks
* Generate embeddings
* Store embeddings in a database
* Retrieve relevant content
* Send it to an LLM
* Handle responses properly

All these tasks required a lot of engineering and complicated code. LangChain simplifies this and handles all these complex parts for you.

---

## 🧠 How an App Works Without LangChain (Example)

Imagine an app where you upload a PDF and chat with it. You can ask questions like:

* "Explain page 5 like I am 5 years old"
* "Create true/false questions for Linear Regression"
* "Give summary of Decision Trees"

To build this app, you need to:

1. Upload PDF → store it in cloud storage
2. Split PDF → into multiple pages/paragraphs
3. Generate embeddings → convert each page into a number vector
4. Save embeddings → in a special database
5. User asks a question → convert the question into embeddings
6. Semantic Search → find the most relevant pages
7. LLM Brain → read only those pages, understand the question, generate an answer

This architecture is powerful but very difficult to implement manually.

---

## 🔍 What is Semantic Search?

Semantic Search performs search based on meaning instead of keyword matching.

**Example:**
Question: "How many runs has Virat Kohli scored?"
The system compares the meaning of the question with embeddings of each paragraph and picks the most relevant paragraph automatically.

---

## 🚧 Main Challenges Without LangChain

| Challenge             | Explanation                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Understanding queries | LLM must understand natural language       |
| Generating answers    | It should produce context-aware text       |
| Infrastructure        | Running LLMs on your servers is expensive  |
| Orchestration         | Connecting 5–6 components manually is hard |

LangChain solves all of these.

---

## 🎯 Benefits of LangChain

### 1️⃣ Chains

You can create pipelines where output of one step becomes input of another.

```
Load PDF → Split → Embeddings → Store → Search → LLM → Answer
```

No manual wiring needed.

### 2️⃣ Model Agnostic

Use any model (OpenAI, Google Gemini, LLaMA, etc.)
Switching requires only 1–2 lines of code.

### 3️⃣ Huge Ecosystem

* Many document loaders
* Many text splitters
* Many embedding models
* Many vector databases

Everything is plug-and-play.

### 4️⃣ Memory Support

LangChain remembers past conversation context.

If user asks:

```
What are the parts of Linear Regression?
```

Then asks:

```
Give interview questions on this algorithm.
```

The system still knows "this" refers to Linear Regression.

# 📌 LangChain – Video 4 

## 🔷 Why this video is important

The speaker explains that before writing code in LangChain, we must first understand how the framework is organized and what components it provides. This video builds a roadmap for the upcoming tutorials.

## 🔁 Quick Recap of Previous Video

In the last video, we learned:

* LangChain is an open-source framework that helps build LLM-powered apps.
* It becomes difficult to create apps that:

  * Read documents
  * Split them into chunks
  * Store embeddings
  * Search relevant content
  * Send it to an LLM
  * Get and format the answer

LangChain solves this by connecting all parts efficiently using minimal code.

We also learned:

* Chains help link components together like a pipeline.
* LangChain is model-agnostic — meaning we can switch models like OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, etc. without rewriting the whole code.
* LangChain is used today for:

  * Chatbots
  * Knowledge assistants
  * AI agents

## 📦 LangChain Components

LangChain has six major components:

1. Models
2. Prompts
3. Chains
4. Memory
5. Indexes
6. Agents

If you understand these six, you understand most of LangChain.

## 1️⃣ Models

Models are the core interface that communicates with AI models (LLMs).

### Why models are needed:

Different companies give different APIs for communication.

Without LangChain, you need different code for:

* OpenAI’s GPT
* Anthropic’s Claude
* Google Gemini

Each API behaves differently.

LangChain standardizes this by giving a single interface that works for all models.
Changing model provider requires just **1–2 lines of code**.

### Types of Models

* **Language Models** → text in, text out
  *Example: ChatGPT replies to a question*

* **Embedding Models** → text in, vector out
  *Used for semantic search*

## 2️⃣ Prompts

Prompts are the input we give to LLMs.

LLM output depends heavily on how we write prompts. Changing even one word can change the answer.

### Types of prompts in LangChain:

* **Dynamic prompts** — Fill values later using placeholders
  *Example: "Summarize {topic} in a {tone}"*

* **Role-based prompts** — Tell the model who it is
  *Example: "You are an experienced doctor"*

* **Few-shot prompts** — Provide examples first, then ask a question

Prompt engineering is now a real job profile because LLMs are very sensitive to input wording.

## 3️⃣ Chains

Chains let you create pipelines.

They automate the process where:

* Output of one step becomes input to the next
* You don’t manually pass values

### Examples:

* English text → Translate to Hindi → Summarize it → Return final result
* **Parallel chains**: multiple models run at the same time
* **Conditional chains**: different execution based on rules

Chains remove repeated coding and handle flow automatically.

## 4️⃣ Indexes

Indexes allow your LLM to access external knowledge, such as:

* PDFs
* Websites
* Company databases

### Indexes are made of four parts:

| Component       | Meaning                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Document Loader | Load PDFs, pages, files              |
| Text Splitter   | Break large text into chunks         |
| Vector Store    | Store embeddings (special DB)        |
| Retriever       | Find relevant chunks and return them |

Indexes enable private and custom knowledge search — something ChatGPT cannot do alone.

## 5️⃣ Memory

LLMs are stateless, meaning they forget previous messages unless we send history again.

Memory solves this by storing previous conversation context.

### Types of memory:

* **Conversation buffer** → stores full history
* **Window memory** → stores recent messages
* **Summary memory** → stores summarized history
* **Custom memory** → stores special info like preferences

Memory makes chatbots feel continuous and human-like.

## 6️⃣ Agents

Agents are advanced chatbots that can think and take actions.

### Difference:

| Chatbot    | Agent                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Only talks | Talks + performs tasks |

### Agents have:

* **Reasoning ability** → Break tasks into steps
* **Tools access** → They can call APIs, search the web, calculate, etc.

#### Example:

User: *Multiply today's temperature of Delhi by 3*

Agent:

* Gets weather from API
* Uses calculator
* Returns result

This is why agents are considered the next big thing in AI.

## 🎯 Conclusion

* LangChain has six core components.
* Understanding them gives a complete foundation.
* Next videos will dive deeper into each component, starting with Models.
* No code yet — this video builds conceptual understanding first.
